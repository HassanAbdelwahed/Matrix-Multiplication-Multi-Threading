# Matrix-Multiplication-Multi-Threading
multi-threaded matrix multiplication program.
## Overview
implementation of  a multi-threaded matrix multiplication program.
The input to the program is two matrixes A(xy) and B(yz) that are read from corresponding text files. The output is a matrix C(x*z) that is written to an output text file.

A parallelized version of matrix multiplication can be done using one of these three methods:

 * A thread computes the output C matrix i.e. without multi-threading. (A thread per matrix).
